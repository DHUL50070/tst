<p>DISCLAIMER:
This is not illegal nor is it breaking rules because we have the Freedom of Press, thus freedom given to us by the 1st Amendment that we learned about for at least 3 years. This isn’t inappropriate either, nor is it breaking any school policies. We are giving people ACCURATE information, which is good.
